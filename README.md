## How It Works

The application uses a brute-force approach to generate Solana keypairs until it finds one matching your desired pattern. The backend is built with Flask and uses the `solders` library for efficient keypair generation.

### Performance

- Generates thousands of wallets per second
- Performance depends on your CPU
- Longer phrases take exponentially longer to find

### Security

- All keys are generated locally
- No keys are stored or transmitted
- Use at your own risk - always verify keys before use
